# Daniel's Aurora Sweep Layout

We've been using a layout for a long time that could use some tweaks. This will be painful, but could help improve the layout based on what we've learned.

## Some stuff that would be nice:

* Homerow mods: These could be nice to free our thumb keys that we almost waste by having one shot modifiers for SHIFT and CTRL
  * At the very least, it feels like control could be replaced with a more useful layer (potentially for num pad too)
* Moving the ENTER and BACKSPACE keys to stronger fingers. Even if this means moving them to a layer or a combo
* Make use of more combos for common stuff
* Mouse movement and clicking

## What do we use Control for?

* Ctrl+B for Tmux (This is one of the few where we use OSM)
* Ctrl+C as Esc in Vim (This is one of the few where we use OSM)
* Ctrl+A for Copilot completion
* Ctrl+F for opening projects
* Ctrl+U & Ctrl+D for scrolling in Vim 
* Ctrl+W for window management in Vim
* Ctrl+R for Redo in Vim

## Homerow

Maybe (s)agc

## Possible Combos

### Candidates for combos

* '
* "
* `
* :
* = 
* &
* |
* _
* -
* +

### Supa strong

* r + s => - / _
* e + i => = / +
* w + f => ESCAPE
* u + y => BACKSPACE
* x + c => TAB
* , + . => ENTER
* s + t => ; / :
* n + e => ' / "

### More difficult (but still usable)

* f + p => 
* c + d => 
* l + u => 
* h + , => ` / ~

### Hard but OK for less used stuff

* w + f + p 
* l + u + y
* r + s + t
* n + e + i
* x + c + d
* h + , + .
